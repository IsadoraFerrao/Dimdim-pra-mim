App mobile for finances

Six out of ten people that are in debt in Brazil are women. We believe a huge factor that interferes in the number of people with debts is the absence of financial education. Financial education is not taught in Brazilian’s schools, but it is extremely important to improve the quality of life Brazilian population. Since 1950 the number of women economically active tripled. The increasing number of women in the labor market can inject 382 billion reais in Brazilian economy. More women entering the labor market and being economically active shows us the importance to help people in regards to financial education. That motivated us to create an App focused on women to help them to understand better where their money is going, get out of difficult financial conditions, and reach their life objectives. 

Key problems of our target customer:
Do not know how to save money or invest 
Spend more money than what they have in their bank account 
Do not know how to plan and do not see its importance
Do not see the real value of the money they spend

We decided to create an app integrated with a Chatbot that will answer customers' main concerns regarding very basic financial questions and also will engage the user to keep a financial health condition. We also display their expenses in the app with simple information as the sum of payments by each category. We do not want to display charts, percentages, and equations because studies says that the level of math knowledge of Brazilian population is very low (33% do not even understand the total sum of a grocery store shopping).

Why are we different from other apps?
In order to make it easy for people to better understand the real value of their money, we have mapped this value to the quantity of hours the person has worked to conquer that money, based on their salary. That way the person can understand in an easy way the real value of the money they make. Other available apps display charts/percentages, things that we consider that most of brazilian population do not understand. Instead of charts and percentages we speak in a simple way using only the total amount of expenses in each category. 
We help women to create the habit of saving money. We create a mathematical model behind the app that makes computations and guides the customer, for example, to divide the value of a bill into smaller goals to be reached every month, before the bill’s payment day.
We engage our users through a simple and engaging connection. Sophia is way more than a ChatBot, she is (almost) a real person and she has a life away from the app (in her instagram: @soph_ia_tech),, where she also shares knowledge. She is a friend that wants to teach you everything she has learned reading all the books in the world.
